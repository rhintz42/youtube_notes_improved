youtube_notes_improved
======================

This is the improved version of youtube_notes that uses backbonejs



Next Steps
----------
* When editing notes, they should have their own shortcuts mode
* Create settings panel on the right
    * Show playback rate
    * Current Mode in
* Create more of a division
    * The note list should control selecting elements
        * Don't let the actual note views see any of the selecting
* The note list should have state
    * Should know about the current note selected
* Should be able to sort the notes by time
* Should be able to search through the notes
* Should be able to add tags on the notes



I'd be really cool if could help take notes on the notes that you make.
* Like if you had a bunch of definitions and shit, maybe automatically make flash cards
    * Use regex expressions to easily get all of the definitions and names and such
* Be able to isolate the notes and allow the user to make notes on those notes
    * Cornell notes

Have ability to automatically create different types of notes from shortcuts
* normal note
* code note
* quote note

Be able to change the type with a shortcut mid-edit

Add vim controls to editor mode
